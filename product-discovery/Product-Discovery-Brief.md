### Product Discovery Brief: Onboarding AI Agents for Product Discovery Brainstorming  

---

#### **1. Problem Statement**  
Our software development team is tasked with brainstorming ideas for a new product, but our current process is limited by time constraints, repetitive ideation patterns, and difficulty analyzing large datasets for insights. We want to explore how AI agents can enhance creativity, provide data-driven suggestions, and streamline the brainstorming process. However, the team has no prior experience with AI agents, making it crucial to establish a clear onboarding and integration plan.

#### **2. Goals for Onboarding AI Agents**  
- Introduce AI agents as collaborative tools to assist in product discovery activities.  
- Train the team to effectively utilize AI agents for generating innovative ideas and analyzing user needs.  
- Ensure seamless integration of AI agents into existing workflows without disrupting productivity.  
- Validate the value of AI agents in improving the quality and efficiency of brainstorming sessions.

#### **3. Roles AI Agents Will Play in the Brainstorming Process**  
- **Idea Generation:** Provide diverse, creative suggestions based on prompts or problem statements.  
- **Data Analysis:** Analyze user feedback, market trends, and competitor data to identify opportunities.  
- **Pattern Recognition:** Highlight recurring themes or gaps in brainstorming sessions to inspire new directions.  
- **Facilitation Support:** Act as a virtual assistant to structure brainstorming sessions and ensure alignment with goals.

#### **4. Key Steps for Onboarding and Integration**  

1. **Research and Select AI Tools**  
   - Identify AI tools suited for brainstorming (e.g., ChatGPT, Jasper, or specialized ideation platforms).  
   - Ensure compatibility with existing team tools (e.g., Slack, Jira, Notion).  

2. **Define Use Cases**  
   - Outline specific scenarios where AI agents will contribute (e.g., generating product ideas, analyzing customer pain points).  

3. **Pilot Testing**  
   - Conduct a small-scale trial with a subset of the team to test the AI agent’s capabilities in a controlled environment.  

4. **Training and Onboarding**  
   - Provide training sessions to familiarize the team with how to interact with AI agents effectively.  
   - Develop simple guidelines for crafting effective prompts tailored to brainstorming needs.  

5. **Integration into Workflows**  
   - Embed AI agents into existing processes (e.g., include them in brainstorming meetings or asynchronous ideation).  
   - Assign a team member as a point of contact for managing AI-related tasks and troubleshooting issues.  

6. **Iterative Feedback Loop**  
   - Gather feedback from team members on the effectiveness of the AI agents after each session.
   - Refine workflows and adjust how the team interacts with the agents based on insights.

#### **5. Success Metrics**  
- **Idea Generation:** The number of actionable ideas generated by AI agents during brainstorming sessions (target: 5–10 per session).  
- **Team Adoption:** Percentage of team members actively engaging with AI agents (target: 80% participation).  
- **Efficiency Gains:** Reduction in time spent on manual ideation processes (target: 20% improvement).  
- **Quality of Insights:** Positive feedback from team members on the relevance and creativity of ideas provided by AI agents (target: 90% satisfaction rate).
