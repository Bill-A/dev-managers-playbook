## 3. Discuss Strategies for Technical Design

1. **System Architecture Diagram:**
   - Use a layered architecture to separate concerns and improve maintainability.
   - Create a context diagram to illustrate the system's interaction with users and external systems.
   - Develop container diagrams to show the application's components, such as the web server, database, and client applications.
   - For detailed design, use component diagrams to show the relationships and interactions between the application's internal components.

2. **Technology Stack Selection:**
   - Frontend: Use React or Angular for building a responsive and interactive user interface.
   - Backend: Consider Node.js with Express or Java with Spring Boot for handling server-side logic and API requests.
   - Database: Use a relational database like PostgreSQL or a NoSQL database like MongoDB, depending on the data structure and query requirements.
   - Hosting: Deploy the application on a cloud platform like AWS or Azure for scalability and reliability.

3. **Data Models and API Specifications:**
   - Define data models to represent feedback entities, including session ratings, comments, and user information.
   - Use OpenAPI or Swagger to design API specifications, detailing endpoints for submitting feedback, retrieving feedback data, and managing sessions.
   - Ensure APIs support common operations such as Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) for managing feedback data.

4. **Security Requirements:**
   - Implement input validation and sanitization to prevent injection attacks.
   - Use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit and secure API endpoints.
   - Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms, such as OAuth or JWT, to control access to the application.
   - Regularly conduct security testing and audits to identify and fix vulnerabilities.

5. **Performance Requirements:**

   - Use caching strategies, such as in-memory caching with Redis, to reduce database load and improve response times.
   - Implement asynchronous processing for non-blocking operations and background tasks.
   - Optimize frontend performance by minimizing asset sizes and using lazy loading techniques.

## 4. Discuss Strategies Development Workflow

1. **Test Automation Approach**:
   - **Unit Testing**: Automate unit tests for individual components to ensure they work as expected in isolation. Use frameworks like Jest or Mocha for JavaScript applications.
   - **Integration Testing**: Automate tests that verify the interaction between different components or services. Tools like Cypress or Selenium can be used for this purpose.
   - **End-to-End (E2E) Testing**: Automate E2E tests to simulate real user scenarios and ensure the entire application works as intended. Tools like Cypress or Playwright are recommended.
   - **Best Practices**: Prioritize tests for automation based on critical functionality, maintain a clear test strategy, and ensure test scripts are modular and reusable. Keep records of test results for analysis.

2. **Code Review Standards**:
   - **Review Process**: Implement a code review process where peers review code before merging. Use tools like GitHub or GitLab for pull requests.
   - **Best Practices**: Review fewer than 400 lines of code at a time, limit review sessions to 60 minutes, and provide constructive feedback. Use a checklist to ensure consistency and capture metrics for improvement.
   - **Communication**: Encourage open-ended questions and bidirectional conversations during reviews. Offer alternatives and workarounds when suggesting changes.

3. **Documentation Requirements**:
   - **Clarity and Conciseness**: Use clear and simple language, avoid jargon, and ensure documentation is easy to read and update.
   - **Standardization**: Use standardized templates and processes for documentation. Create a style guide to maintain consistency in terminology, voice, and formatting.
   - **Maintenance**: Keep documentation up to date with the latest changes in the codebase and ensure it is easily accessible to the team.

4. **Pair/Mob Programming Guidelines**:
   - **Pair Programming**: Encourage developers to work in pairs, with one person coding (driver) and the other reviewing and guiding (navigator). Rotate roles frequently to ensure engagement and learning.
   - **Mob Programming**: Utilize mob programming for complex problems or when onboarding new team members. The entire team works together on a single task, sharing knowledge and ideas.
   - **Best Practices**: Treat team members with respect, focus on quality code, and use tools like mob.sh to facilitate remote collaboration. Apply Test-Driven Development (TDD) to drive quality.

## 5. Discuss Strategies for DevOps

1. **CI/CD Pipeline Configuration:**
   - Implement a robust CI/CD pipeline to automate the build, test, and deployment processes. This ensures rapid and reliable delivery of application updates.
   - Utilize tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions to set up the pipeline. These tools support integration with various testing and deployment services.
   - Ensure the pipeline is fault-tolerant and scalable to handle increased load and complexity as the project grows.

2. **Environment Management:**
   - Create separate environments for development, testing, and production to isolate changes and ensure stability.
   - Use Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Terraform or AWS CloudFormation to automate environment setup and management.
   - Implement containerization using Docker and orchestration with Kubernetes for consistent and efficient environment management.

3. **Monitoring and Observability:**
   - Set up comprehensive monitoring using tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or Dynatrace to track application performance and detect issues early.
   - Implement observability practices by collecting and analyzing logs, metrics, and traces to gain insights into system behavior and performance.
   - Use distributed tracing tools like OpenTelemetry to understand the flow of requests and identify bottlenecks.

4. **Security Protocols:**
   - Integrate security into the CI/CD pipeline with DevSecOps practices, ensuring security checks are part of the development process.
   - Use tools like Snyk or OWASP ZAP for static and dynamic application security testing.
   - Implement access controls and encryption to protect sensitive data and maintain compliance with security standards.

## 6. Discuss Strategies for AI usage

1. **AI for Code Generation**:
   - Utilize AI-powered code generation tools to assist in writing boilerplate code, reducing manual effort, and speeding up the development process. These tools can suggest code snippets, complete functions, and even generate entire modules based on input requirements.
   - Implement AI models that understand the context of our application and provide relevant code suggestions, ensuring that generated code aligns with our architecture and design patterns.

2. **Testing and QA Automation**:
   - Employ AI-driven testing tools to automate the generation and execution of test cases. These tools can analyze code changes and determine the most critical tests to run, optimizing our testing process.
   - Use AI to predict potential areas of failure or bugs by analyzing historical data and code patterns, allowing us to proactively address issues before they manifest.

3. **Code Review Assistance**:
   - Integrate AI tools into our code review process to automatically check for coding standards, potential bugs, and performance issues. AI can provide recommendations for code improvements, ensuring consistency and quality across the codebase.
   - Leverage AI to assist in identifying technical debt and suggesting refactoring opportunities, helping maintain a clean and efficient codebase.

4. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Use AI to analyze application performance metrics and identify bottlenecks or inefficient code paths. AI can suggest optimizations that improve response times and resource utilization.
   - Implement AI-driven profiling tools that continuously monitor application performance and provide insights into potential improvements, ensuring our application remains responsive and scalable.
